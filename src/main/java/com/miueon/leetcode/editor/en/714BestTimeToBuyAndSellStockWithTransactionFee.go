  //You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on
// the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee. 
//
// Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transaction
//s as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction. 
//
// Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you m
//ust sell the stock before you buy again). 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: prices = [1,3,2,8,4,9], fee = 2
//Output: 8
//Explanation: The maximum profit can be achieved by:
//- Buying at prices[0] = 1
//- Selling at prices[3] = 8
//- Buying at prices[4] = 4
//- Selling at prices[5] = 9
//The total profit is ((8 - 1) - 2) + ((9 - 4) - 2) = 8.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: prices = [1,3,7,5,10,3], fee = 3
//Output: 6
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 1 <= prices.length <= 5 * 104 
// 1 <= prices[i] < 5 * 104 
// 0 <= fee < 5 * 104
