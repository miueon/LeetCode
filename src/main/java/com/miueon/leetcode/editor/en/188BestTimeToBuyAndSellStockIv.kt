  //You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given 
//stock on the ith day. 
//
// Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k tr
//ansactions. 
//
// Notice that you may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e.,
// you must sell the stock before you buy again). 
//
// 
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
//Output: 2
//Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 
//4-2 = 2.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
//Output: 7
//Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 
//6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3
//-0 = 3.
// 
//
// 
// Constraints: 
//
// 
// 0 <= k <= 100 
// 0 <= prices.length <= 1000 
// 0 <= prices[i] <= 1000
